# One click Automatic1111

This is just a launcher for [AUTOMATIC1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) using google colab.

[AUTOMATIC1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) is currently the best web ui to work with stable diffusion.

This launcher runs in a single cell and uses google drive as your disk. This means your generations are saved to gdrive and faster startup times.
